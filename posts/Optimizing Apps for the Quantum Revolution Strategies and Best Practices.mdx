## Quantum Computing: A Paradigm Shift
Quantum computing operates on  the principles of  quantum mechanics enabling the manipulation and processing of quantum bits or qubits. Unlike classical  bits, which  can only be in a state of 0 or 1 qubits can simultaneously exist  in a superposition of both states.  This unique property coupled with quantum entanglement, allows  quantum computers to perform calculations exponentially faster than  classical computers.
